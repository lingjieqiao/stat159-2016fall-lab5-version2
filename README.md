This repository holds the information regarding lab 5. This lab was done by Lingjie Qiao and Minsu Kim. 

## Task 1: Working on the master branch
This task went pretty smoothly because the users make changes and push the changes after pulling from the master branch. Therefore, there is no merging conflict or errors occurrred in the process. Even though the files are modified and created by different users, there would not be a systemic problem regarding the collaboration.

## Task 2: Resolving Conflicts

## Task 3: Working on multiple branches

## Task4: Both the users are on different branches

## Task 5: Both the users are on different branches w/ conflicts
